# Transition between the desktop view and the mobile view

The desktop view and the mobile view are transited automatically when the window size changes at the crossover
point of 1024px, an iPad size.

1. When the browser is resized to above 1024px, the interface is automatically transited to the desktop view as the
screenshot below:

screenshot below:
